## Introduction
This is L3 MIAGE students project of MSPL about diamonds.
The goal of this project is to find the main factor that determine the price of a diamond between several one such as it's carat, it's color, it's width...

To do that, we have taken a dataset found on kaggle about diamonds from 2017. It countains more than 58000 observations and about 10 variables.  
The variables are:    
- **price**: The price of the diamond in $ (\$326--\$18,823)  
- **carat**:  The weight of the diamond in grams (one carat = 0.2 grams) (0.2--5.01)  
- **cut**:  The quality of the diamond's cut, which strongly influences how it reflects light (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)    
- **color**:  The color of diamonds ranges from colorless to light yellow/light brown (‘J’ (worst) to ‘D’ (best)). Colorless diamonds are the rarest  
Other natural colors (such as blue, red, or pink) are called “fancy” and their color evaluation differs from that of colorless white diamonds.
- **clarity**:  A measure of the diamond's clarity (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))   
- **x**:  Length in mm (0--10.74)  
- **y**:  Width in mm (0--58.9)  
- **z**:  Depth inn mm (0--31.8)   
- **depth**: Total depth of the diamond, expressed as a percentage relative to its average diameter = z / ((x + y) / 2) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43–79)  
- **table**: Width of the top facet, expressed as a percentage of the diamond’s width (43–95)    

By using this dataset, we decided to answer the question "**What is the most important factor in determining the price of a diamond?**"
 
## Methodology
### Data Clean-up Procedures
Before conducting our analysis, we made data cleaning steps to ensure data quality and accuracy:  
- The first column in the dataset was an unnecessary index variable, which we removed as it added no informational value.  
- We identified and excluded 20 rows with impossible physical measurements. In fact, some diamonds had a value of 0 for at least one of the dimensions (x, y, or z), which is impossible for a real diamond.  

### Scientific Workflow
We initially observed that carat was by far the most influential factor in determining a diamond’s price.   
In order to assess the influence of other variables, we needed to control for carat, i.e., neutralize its overwhelming effect.  
To do so, we chose to focus our analysis on diamonds with a carat of approximately 1, as this is the most represented group in the dataset.  
By examining diamonds inside of this carat range, we could then analyze how other factors such as cut, clarity, and color affect the price.
   
We concluded that among the physical size measurements (x, y, z, depth, table), carat is the most decisive factor affecting price.   
So, we decided not to focus further on the individual dimensional variables but rather concentrate on other quality attributes such as cut, clarity, and color, which also influence the price.  
Our analysis is focused on these characteristics after accounting the carat weight.  
   
### Data Representation Choices
We have chosen to represent the most of the datas in a light blue, a color that remember diamonds.

## References  
  

We first start by reading the input data
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
diamonds_data <- read_delim("./data/diamonds_data.csv",delim=",");

# Ignore the first variable because it's useless (an index)
diamonds_data <- diamonds_data %>% select(-1)

# filter the x y and z variables only keeping the one greater than 0
diamonds_data <- diamonds_data %>%
  filter(x > 0 & y > 0 & z > 0)

# diamonds_data %>% arrange(desc(price)) %>% head(1000)
diamonds_data 
```


Now we create an histogram depending of the price 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds_data, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "white") + # Draws the histogram with bars of width 500 filled with steel blue and white borders
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(300, 19000), breaks = seq(0, 19000, 2000)) + # Sets the X-axis limits (from 300 to 19,000) and tick marks every 2000
  labs(
    title = "Répartition du prix des diamants",
    x = "Prix ($)",
    y = "Nombre de diamants"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)
```

Linear model to estimate the overall trend depending of the carat using  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create personalised intervals: 0 → 4.1 incrementing of 0.5, then a final jump until the maximum
breaks <- c(seq(0.1, 4.1, by = 0.5), max(diamonds_data$carat) + 0.1)

diamonds_data %>%
  mutate(carat_bin = cut(carat, breaks = breaks, include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(carat_bin) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat_bin, y = mean_price, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linewidth = 2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Prix moyen de diamants en fonction du carat",
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Prix moyen ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create interval step of 0.2 for the carat
breaks <- seq(0.2, max(diamonds_data$carat)+0.2, by = 0.2)

# Ajouter une colonne avec les tranches de carat
diamonds_data %>%
  mutate(carat_bin = cut(carat, breaks = breaks, include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(carat_bin) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat_bin, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orchid", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Nombre de diamants par tranche de carat (intervalle de 0.2)",
    x = "Tranche de carat",
    y = "Nombre de diamants"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Take only the carat between 0.9 and 1.1
diamonds_filtered <- diamonds_data %>%
  filter(carat >= 0.9 & carat <= 1.1) %>%
  mutate(cut = fct_relevel(cut, "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal"))

# Graphique boxplot
ggplot(diamonds_filtered, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Prix selon la qualité de coupe (à carat ~1)",
    x = "Qualité de coupe",
    y = "Prix ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Filter on ~1 carat and reorganize by level of clarity ascending
diamonds_filtered <- diamonds_data %>%
  filter(carat >= 0.9 & carat <= 1.1) %>%
    mutate(color = fct_relevel(color, "J", "I", "H", "G", "F", "E", "D"))

# Boxplot for the clarity clarity
ggplot(diamonds_filtered, aes(x = color, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Prix selon la couleur (à carat  ~1)",
    x = "Clarté",
    y = "Prix ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

``` 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Filter on ~1 carat and reorganize by level of clarity ascending
diamonds_filtered <- diamonds_data %>%
  filter(carat >= 0.9 & carat <= 1.1) %>%
  mutate(clarity = fct_relevel(clarity, "I1", "SI2", "SI1", "VS2", "VS1", "VVS2", "VVS1", "IF"))

# Boxplot for the clarity clarity
ggplot(diamonds_filtered, aes(x = clarity, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Prix selon la clarté (à carat  ~1)",
    x = "Clarté",
    y = "Prix ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

```
